0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
_______________________________________________________________________________
In C programming,

A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e.,
direct address of the memory location. Every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using
ampersand (&) operator, which denotes an address in memory.

A String is a data type that stores the sequence of characters in an array.
A string in C always ends with a null character (\0), which indicates the
termination of the string

An array is defined as the collection of similar type of data items stored at
contiguous memory locations. Arrays are the derived data type in C programming language which can store the primitive type of data such as int, char, double, float, etc. It also has the capability to store the collection of derived data types, such as pointers, structure, etc.
