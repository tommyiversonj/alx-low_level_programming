0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
In c, we can divide a large program into the basic building blocks known as function. The function contains the set of programming statements enclosed by {}. A function can be called multiple times to provide reusability and modularity to the C program. In other words, we can say that the collection of functions creates a program. The function is also known as procedureor subroutinein other programming languages.

C supports nesting of loops in C. Nesting of loops is the feature in C that allows the looping of statements inside another loop. Let's observe an example of nesting loops in C.

Any number of loops can be defined inside another loop, i.e., there is no restriction for defining any number of loops. The nesting level can be defined at n times. You can define any type of loop inside another loop; for example, you can define 'while' loop inside a 'for' loop.

1. isdigit
Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

2. Collaboration is multiplication
Write a function that multiplies two integers.

3. The numbers speak for themselves
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4. I believe in numbers and signs
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
