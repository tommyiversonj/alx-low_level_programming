Low-Level Programming
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture 
commands or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or 
assembly language. Because of the low (hence the word) abstraction between the language and machine language, low-level languages are sometimes described 
as being "close to the hardware". 

Programs written in low-level languages tend to be relatively non-portable, due to being optimized for a certain type of system architecture.Low-level 
languages can convert to machine code without a compiler or interpreter second-generation programming languages use a simpler processor called an assembler and the resulting code runs directly on the processor. A program written in a low-level language can be made to run very quickly, with a small memory footprint.

Low-Level Programmming in C

C language is one of the most popular computer languages today because it is a structured, high level and machine independent language. It allows software developers to develop software without worrying about the hardware platforms, where they will be implemented.

It can be used to write high-performance code for both application and system software.Thus, C is best suited where speed, space, and portability are important. Most of the operating systems and gaming software are also written in C.

But wonder why C language is called as a mid-level language? Here are the reasons:

C has the features of both assembly level languages i.e low-level languages and higher level languages. So thatâ€™s why C is generally called as a middle-level Language. The user uses C language for writing an operating system and generates menu driven customer billing system.

C programming supports Inline assembly language programs. We can directly access system registers with the help of inline assembly language feature in C. C programming is used to access memory directly using a pointer. C programming also supports high-level language features.

It is more user-friendly as compared to previous languages and also C programming is a middle-level language.

C programming bridges the gap between traditional machine level language and more conventional high-level languages. Middle-level programming languages are closely related to the machine as well as human being.

As with C language, we are able to manipulate bits, bytes, and addresses. It can interact with direct hardware and also carry out operation related to memory management language, behave like a high-level language through functions, give modular programming and breakups, increase efficiency and re-usability. It also gives access to memory through pointers and supports low-level programming.

C language also supports high-level language features and is more user-friendly as compared to previous languages.
