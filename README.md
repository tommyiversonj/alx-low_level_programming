#Low-Level Programming
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
###A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture 
commands or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or 
assembly language. Because of the low (hence the word) abstraction between the language and machine language, low-level languages are sometimes described 
as being "close to the hardware". 
###Programs written in low-level languages tend to be relatively non-portable, due to being optimized for a certain type of system architecture.Low-level 
languages can convert to machine code without a compiler or interpreter second-generation programming languages use a simpler processor called an assembler and the 
resulting code runs directly on the processor. A program written in a low-level language can be made to run very quickly, with a small memory footprint.
