C - Variables, if, else, while

C Variables

A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable. The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C is case-sensitive. 

If Statement

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true. Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false. Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false. Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.

Else

In the C Programming Language, the #else directive provides an alternate action when used with the #if, #ifdef, or #ifndef directives. The preprocessor will include the C source code that follows the #else statement when the condition for the #if, #ifdef, or #ifndef directive evaluates to false.

While Statement

The while statement lets you repeat a statement until a specified expression becomes false.
